# Color Output of Package manager

- Open `/etc/pacman.conf`
- Uncomment `Color` option

# Setting Mount Points and Options for Booting

- Determine `UUID` of your device using `sudo blkid` command
- Open `/etc/fstab`
- Remove everything and paste the following updating your `UUID`:-

```sh
# Static information about the filesystems.
# See fstab(5) for details.

# <file system> <dir> <type> <options> <dump> <pass>

# Root filesystem
UUID=85e342a3-0482-484a-9cb1-f6b17af9dd6b	/         	ext4    rw,relatime,commit=30,discard	0 1

# EFI Partition (for UEFI boot)
UUID=83D7-9CA3                                 /efi             vfat        defaults,noatime            0 2

# Swap file
/swapfile                                      none             swap         defaults,pri=1             0 0
```

# Installing `yay` (Aur Helper)

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
yay -Y --gendb
yay -Syu --devel
yay -Y --devel --save
```

# Setting up GPG

`nvim $GNUPGHOME/gpg-agent.conf`

In the `gpg-agent.conf` add the following

```bash
pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-curses
```

Now, run following command

```bash
gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
gpgconf --launch gpg-agent
```

```bash
gpg --full-generate-key
```

Choose:

- Key type: 1 (RSA and RSA)

- Key size: 4096

- Expiry: Your choice (e.g., 1y)

- Name & email: match your GitHub email

- Passphrase: choose something strong

`gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long`

Note the Key ID, e.g., ABC123DEF4567890.

```bash
git config --global user.signingkey ABC123DEF4567890
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

For editing we can either use:

```bash
gpg --expert --edit-key ABC123DEF4567890
gpg --edit-key ABC123DEF4567890
```

# greetd setup for river

In file `/etc/greetd/config.toml` customize the following,

```toml
[terminal]
# The VT to run the greeter on. Can be "next", "current" or a number
# designating the VT.
vt = 1

# The default session, also known as the greeter.
[default_session]

# `agreety` is the bundled agetty/login-lookalike. You can replace `/bin/sh`
# with whatever you want started, such as `sway`.
command = "agreety --cmd river"

# The user to run the command as. The privileges this user must have depends
# on the greeter. A graphical greeter may for example require the user to be
# in the `video` group.
user = "abhinaya"

# enable autologin
[initial_session]
command = "river"
user = "abhinaya"
```

Then, **enable** `greetd.service`.
